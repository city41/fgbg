# FGBG - fighting game backgrounds website

A simple website collecting backgrounds from 2D fighting games.

Available at https://www.fgbg.art

## Status

I have gathered just about every 2D fighter there is on the internet. Which I'll call "phase 1". I'm moving into building tools to make extracting animated backgrounds from games easier, which will probably take a while. Once that is done I will probably really change the site a lot.

## Compatibility

Works best on desktop browsers, but also has a pretty good mobile experience

## Code Quality Warning

I built this site very fast, the code is often pretty raw. I am gradually cleaning it up as I go.

## License

MIT licensed, in general feel free to use the code for anything you want. The background images are all copyright their respective creators.
